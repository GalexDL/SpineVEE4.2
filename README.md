# SpineVEE4.2
SpineVEE 4.2+ Rewrite test

# v3.1.1 (January 13, 2026)
 - Video Export removed cuz of performance issues
 - Updated Image Export to be higher quality with adjustable scale factor
 - rotation control added

# v3.1 Update (January 8, 2026)

There are improvements that can be made with the video exporting stuff but it properly works on all browsers (oh it doesnt), that is all i care about. This should be a very solid template to build off on. Might make a gui for the converter. I suppose there could be a way to add the conversion like system but, is there much of a difference to basically have a translation layer? I suppose to perserve the files and their sizes. Not sure if live making 2.3x file sizes will have a major impact on performance on browsers. also no local loading becuase arggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggh, feel free to figure that out for me 

-  1 New Pokemon Model (I was testing conversion stuff)
-  Skins properly dynmically populate and arent hardcoded
-  Loop Toggle for animations (its a bit funky animation to animation due to how they might be automatically coded to loop)
-  Listed a conversion tool to update models to 4.2.
